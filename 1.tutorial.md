# Tutorial: Animations in Flutter

Let's walk through the [basic tutorial](https://flutter.io/tutorials/animation) from the Flutter documentation and review the related [code snippets](https://github.com/flutter/website/tree/master/src/_includes/code/animation)



## Essential Concepts

### Default / Linear Animations

These are the main [Animation library](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/animation-library.html) classes. 
To use them, first  ```import 'package:flutter/animation.dart';``` in your source file.
 
  * [```Animation<T>```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html) :  contains the _current_ value (of type T) and  status (of type [AnimationStatus](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/AnimationStatus-class.html)) of that animation. Animations are dumb objects that simply maintain animation state and notify registered listeners when that state changes. They don't control their state change or understand how those state changes are used (e.g., to create onscreen motion).

  * [```AnimationController```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html): are the brains behind Animation. They are derived from ```Animation<double>``` giving them a default ```Animation``` that produces values from *lower_bound* 0.0 to *upper_bound* 1.0, on a linear scale over the ```Duration``` specified in their construction. With ```AnimationController``` class you can do the following:
    * start the Animation from a specific _value_
    * pause, play, reverse or stop, the animation
    * set default values for upper and lower bounds 
    * perform a _fling_ effect using physics-based simulations

  * [```Duration```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/dart-core/Duration-class.html) is just a measure of time. The ```AnimationController``` is configured with a Duration value (indicating total length of animation) and value bounds (upper, lower) that it can now use to create a simple linear scale that is used to generate the default Animation _value_ at a given _Tick_ (time offset from the start).

  * [```TickerProvider```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/scheduler/TickerProvider-class.html) generates [```Ticker```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/scheduler/Ticker-class.html) objects that are essentially notifications that a new frame is being rendered on device. The ```AnimationController``` uses these to determine **when** to update the associated ```Animation``` object's value; the **what** (update value itself) is determined by the current offset within that linear scale. 

  * [```Tween```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html) which can operate on an existing ```Animation``` object and interpolate its values onto a different scale (or type). It effectively creates a **new** ```Animation``` object that is tied to the controller's animation timeline (duration and ticks) but generates a different set of values. 
    * This allows different objects to _sync_ against the same animation timeline but employ different animation effects. For example: while the controller animation is defining position co-ordinates for an animated object, a ```ColorTween``` can now generate a color gradient values that change in sync. 
    * More importantly, Tweens can be **chained** to generate a **single** (end) ```Animation``` object that is configured by multiple _transform functions_ in succession, allowing for composite effects to be rendered efficiently.
    * To use Tweens, simply create them with relevant {T begin, T end} values, then use ```.animate(controller)``` to create a new ```Animation<T>``` object that generates values from this basis, in sync with that controller's Animation.

  * [```AnimationStatus```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/AnimationStatus-class.html) is just a helper, providing an enumeration of valid status values for an ```Animation```. The status is set on the Animation by the controller based on its knowledge of the default *upper_bound* and *lower_bound* values. The controller can {reset, pause, forward, reverse, stop, repeat} the animation, impacting status.
    * _completed_ (stopped, at end = hit upper bound)
    * _dismissed_ (stopped, at start = hit lower bound)
    * _forward_ (still running, from start to end)
    * _reverse_ (still running, from end to start)

### Custom / Non-Linear Animations

  What if you wanted to have those values change in a _non-linear_ way over the duration of the ```Animation```. In other words, the controller still has the same {lower-bound value, upper-bound value, time duration} configured -- but now you want the per-tick values to change according to some other function (not a straight line).

  This is where the [```Curve```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/Curve-class.html) class comes in. Flutter provides a number of pre-defined [```Curves```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html) that can be used out of the box to create different effects from _bounceIn_ to _easeIn_, _elasticIn_ and more. And there are two ways for you to employ curves.

> USING ```CurvedAnimation```

Use [```CurvedAnimation```](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/CurvedAnimation-class.html) to apply a non-linear curve to an existing Animation. Widgets can not register as listeners on the _animation_ to get the non-linear value updates on each tick. Usage is as shown. 

```js
 final AnimationController controller =
    new AnimationController( duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500), .. );

 final CurvedAnimation animation =
    new CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.ease);
```

But what if you had more than one transformation function you wanted to apply? Or what if you then wanted to have the values transformed into a different range or type (as allowed by ```Tween```)? This is where you want to explore ```CurveTween```.

> USING ```CurveTween```

Note that you could use a generic Tween on an existing ```CurvedAnimation``` as follows, for non-linear values and interpolation:

```js
final Animation tween = 
    new Tween(begin: 0.0, end: 300.0).animate(animation);
```

However, by using ```CurveTween``` directly you get the benefit of being able to **chain** Tweens to apply different types of transforms _and get a single Animation object at the end_ as follows:

```js
    final AnimationController controller =
        new AnimationController(duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500), ..);

    final Animation animation = 
        new Tween(begin: 0.0, end: 300.0)
        .chain(new CurveTween(curve: Curves.easeIn,))
        .animate(controller);
```

### Usage / In Widgets

The typical process for using Animations in widgets is as follows:

1. Create an ```AnimationController``` for the desired ```Duration``` and with a specified ```TickerProvider``` (see Mixin options).
2. Create a ```Tween``` with the required transforms (value or type interpolation), potentially chaining in non-linear curves as needed.
3. Get the actual ```Animation``` object by invoking ```tween.animate(controller)```. This object will now hold the current value for the tweened Animation over the duration specified in its controller.
4. Add listeners to this Animation object using ```animation.addListener(callback)``` to be notified of value updates on each tick.
5. Implement the callback code to handle value changes, wrapping relevant parts in a _setState_ call to auto-trigger UI refreshes that show the actual animation effects onscreen in response to value changes.
